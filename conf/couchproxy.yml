# This is the couchproxy configuration file. Restart the couchproxy process
# after changing this file for the changes to take effect.
#
# Parameters:
# couchjs:  The fully qualified path to the couchjs view server.
# reducers: The number of couchjs processes to run. We typically want one
#           view server process per core for best rereduce performance.
# nodes:    A list of CouchDB servers with the partitions that they host. Once
#           we start using the proxy with these partitions, we can't change the
#           total number of partitions without carefully repartitioning the database.
#           We can move partitions to new servers easily though. The number of
#           partitions should match the maximum number of servers we think we'll
#           need for our data set.
